### About Me

I'm a developer, actually in the [informatic department of the University of Bordeaux](https://www.iut.u-bordeaux.fr/info/).

I use python, javascript, php, sql for my personal project and use assembly (powerPC G5), c, c# and java for the university. I also knew c++ (arduino), batch (*windows*) and bash (*linux*).

### My cool repositories (in order of importance)

1. PcJsApi

[![PCJsApi](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=MisterMine01&repo=PCJsApi&theme=radical)](https://github.com/MisterMine01/PCJsApi)

The most useful (i use it in all my code (Utopia, Nadia, and most of my private repositories) ) it's a cursor for pointing to a php function with your request [an exemple with FDS](https://github.com/MisterMine01/FDS)

2. Utopia

[![Utopia](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=MisterMine01&repo=UtopiaClient&theme=radical)](https://github.com/MisterMine01/UtopiaClient)

Utopia is a game (i made it). the client is, for the moment the only public repositories (but they has **UtopiaBdd** (for the database), **UtopiaServer** (for the battle server), and **UtopiaPrincipalServer** (for the account and the grouping of all battle server) ). The [first version](https://github.com/MisterMine01/PyUtopiaClient/tree/Beta-0.1) was in 2019 in python and continue to evolving again today.

3. Nadia
